# DMOPress Starter Theme
This WordPress theme is meant for designers and developers. It can be used as a starting point for a new website project that uses the [DMOPress WordPress Plugin](https://www.dmopress.com/dmopress/), or as a point of reference for specific functionality.  

Outside of vanilla Bootstrap and FontAwesome, there is no additional CSS. It is completely unstyled and ready to be customized to suit your project requirements.
